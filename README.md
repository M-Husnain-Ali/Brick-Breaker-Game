## üéØ Overview
Brick Breaker is an engaging arcade game that combines classic gameplay with modern features. Built using C++ and Windows GDI for graphics rendering, this implementation offers a smooth and responsive gaming experience. The game features a dynamic ball-and-paddle system where players must strategically bounce the ball to destroy bricks while managing power-ups and avoiding obstacles.

### Technical Highlights
- **Graphics Engine:** Custom-built using Windows GDI for efficient 2D rendering
- **Collision System:** Precise collision detection for ball-brick and ball-paddle interactions
- **State Management:** Robust game state handling with save/load functionality
- **Performance:** Optimized frame rate and smooth animations
- **Memory Management:** Efficient C++ memory handling for game objects

### Game Architecture
- **Main Game Loop:** Implements a fixed time-step game loop for consistent physics
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Modular code structure with separate classes for:
  - Game objects (Ball, Paddle, Bricks)
  - Collision management
  - Power-up system
  - Score tracking
  - State persistence

### Visual Elements
- **Dynamic Graphics:** Smooth animations and visual effects
- **Color Schemes:** Visually distinct brick types and power-ups
- **UI Elements:** 
  - Real-time score display
  - Life counter
  - Power-up indicators
  - Game status messages

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Increasing challenge as levels advance
- **Brick Varieties:**
  - Standard bricks (1 hit)
  - Reinforced bricks (multiple hits)
  - Special bricks (trigger power-ups)
- **Ball Physics:**
  - Realistic bounce angles
  - Speed variations
  - Collision response
- **Paddle Features:**
  - Smooth movement control
  - Size modifications through power-ups
  - Position-based ball deflection

## üíª Requirements
- Windows Operating System
- Microsoft Visual Studio (2022 or later)
  - Desktop development with C++ workload must be installed
  - Windows SDK must be installed
- Minimum screen resolution: 1024x768

## üöÄ Installation & Setup
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install Visual Studio 2022 or later from [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   - During installation, make sure to select "Desktop development with C++" workload

2. **Create New Project**
   - Open Visual Studio
   - Click `Create a new project`
   - Search for and select `Empty Project` (C++)
   - Choose a name for your project and click `Create`

3. **Add Project Files**
   - Copy `game.cpp` and `yourgraphics.h` into your project folder
   - In Solution Explorer, right-click on `Source Files` ‚Üí `Add` ‚Üí `Existing Item`
   - Select `game.cpp`
   - Right-click on `Header Files` ‚Üí `Add` ‚Üí `Existing Item`
   - Select `yourgraphics.h`

4. **Run the Game**
   - Press `F5` to build and run
   - Or use the green play button in the toolbar

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues
- If using MinGW or g++ directly, the compilation will fail due to Windows-specific graphics functions
- The game must be compiled using Visual Studio with the proper Windows SDK and libraries
- Make sure both `game.cpp` and `yourgraphics.h` are in the correct project directories
